# Welcome to Pwnie Island!
Pwn Adventure 3: Pwnie Island is a limited-release, first-person, true open-world MMORPG set on a beautiful island where anything could happen. That's because this game is intentionally vulnerable to all kinds of silly hacks! Flying, endless cash, and more are all one client change or network proxy away. Are you ready for the mayhem?!

# ...wait, what?
No, really! We are security professionals that want to help game designers understand how and why players are able to take advantage of design and programming flaws. By creating a game that is intentionally flawed, we can create an example for developers of what not to do. Our hackable components all live in their own sandbox, too (the net code and game logic are completely custom), so you won't have to hack the engine (Unreal 4) itself!

You see, Pwn Adventure 3 isn't about being a really fun MMORPG (although, we certainly hope it is!). It's about providing hacking challenges for Ghost in the Shellcode 2015 and educating video game developers. After the limited release of the game, we intend to provide write-ups and examples of the flaws present in the game. We hope you'll show off all of your awesome hacks, too!

# I've never heard of this, neat!
This is the sixth year for the Ghost in the Shellcode CTF itself, and the second year for Pwn Adventure. You can find more more details on last year's Unity-based version over at ghostintheshellcode.com.

# Features
Like most modern MMORPGs, Pwn Adventure 3 features plenty of...

## Quests
A large, open world isn't useful unless it's filled with quests. So, just in case the bears and hacking challenges don't keep you busy, we've packed in more quests than ever before. You'll be doing quests until the cows come home!

## Bosses
If world bosses with epic and legendary loot is your thing, we have a game for you! But, beware - some bosses may need more than your buddies and some upgraded gear to overcome...

## Player vs Player
Do you find first-person, player-eat-player action exhilerating? We've got you covered with a toggleable PvP mode available all over the island. But, don't forget - we encourage cheating. Make sure your aimbot is as good as your opponent's!

There's also a large island to explore, epic loot, hidden areas, achievements, pirates, and more!

# Downloads
Pwn Adventure 3: Pwnie Island is available on all 3 major desktop operating systems. Preloads are encrypted and will download the relevant data files. The encrypted client will unlock at 1530 EST on January 16th.

# Requirements
For the best experience, you'll want a computer with at least the following minimum specifications to run Pwn Adventure 3:

Graphics Card: Intel HD 4000 Graphics
OS X: 10.9.2
Linux: Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (may work on others), 64-bit required
Windows: Tested on Win7 (XP may work)
It may be possible to play Pwn Adventure 3 with less, but framerate and quality will suffer considerably.

# Server
Now that the game is over, you can always run your own local server to test with.

Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
A copy of the Linux game client (download from pwnadventure.com), the Game Server binary will be placed into this client alongside the client executable
At least 2GB of RAM, more RAM will allow more instances to be run on a single machine
Linux server download
When can I play?
Pwn Adventure 3 was originally during Shmoocon 2015, from January 16-18, 2015. It is part of the Ghost in the Shellcode CTF event. Servers went live when Ghost in the Shellcode started at 3:30pm EST. While the CTF is now over, we are still running the servers in a limited capacity so others can try it.

# What are the current limits?
We are currently running the server with reduced resources so people can enjoy the game for longer, but that does mean that if too many people join at the same time, it's possible the server will run out of instances. For that reason, we highly recommend you run your own server. Instructions for setting it up are included in the tarball.

# Did we miss something?
The Ghost in the Shellcode organizers are available on the freenode IRC network in #gits-ctf and are happy to help with your questions before and after the event. We're also on Twitter and can always be reached by e-mail at gits at ghost in the shellcode dot com.

Pwn Adventure 3 is the brainchild of one Rusty Wagner. He's responsible for the idea, the planning, and nearly all of the execution (programming, level design, quests, and so forth). Without him, there would be no game! Special thanks also goes to the Ghost in the Shellcode organizers for their support during development and testing.
